Style guide to contributors:
============================
- this document uses ReSpec, see
  http://dev.w3.org/2009/dap/ReSpec.js/documentation.html
- use 80 characters wide lines, whenever possible (except long links)
- keep sections 2 empty lines apart
- put comments in front of sections, for better readability with syntax coloring
  editors
- use indentation with care: it may improve readability, but at the expense of
  line lenght
- when descriptions of attributes is short, use the <dd> elements even when
  the text also contains conformance statements (e.g. MUST, SHOULD, MAY).
  No use repeating the same information in a separate paragraph.

    <section id='abstract'>
      This API provides interfaces to raw UDP sockets, TCP Client sockets and 
      TCP Server sockets.
      <div class="note">
        <p>
          This specification is currently undergoing a major rewrite in order to 
          be based on the Streams API. Currently the reference to the Streams API
          is [[!STREAMS]] but there is ongoing work to align this specification
          with [[!W3C-STREAMS]].
        </p>
        <p>
          In the current version only the interfaces <a>TCPSocket</a> and
          <a>UDPSocket</a> have been rewritten. <a>TCPServerSocket</a> 
          remains to be rewritten.
        </p>
      </div>   
      
      <div class="note">
        <p>
          This is a note on error handling. 
        </p>
        <p>
          When using promises rejection reasons should always be instances of 
          the ECMAScript Error type such as DOMException or the built in 
          ECMAScript error types. See 
          <a href="https://github.com/w3ctag/promises-guide#rejection-reasons-should-be-errors">Promise rejection reasons</a>.
          In the TCP and UDP Socket API specification we need a better granularity 
          of machine readable errors and therefore the <a>SocketError</a> 
          interface was added. This interface extends DOMError with a 
          machine readble error type providing a better granularity of error 
          reporting. However, the <a>SocketError</a> interface can not be used
          by promises so I have temporily just stated a DOMException for 
          promises rejection reasons in the specification. This issue must be 
          further explored and aligned with ongoing discussions in W3C, WHAT WG 
          and ECMA. For example see <a href="http://esdiscuss.org/topic/error-objects-in-w3c-apis">Error objects in W3C APIs</a>.
        </p>

      </div>    
      
      <div class="note">
        <p>
          This is a note on data types of TCP and UDP to send and receive. 
        </p>
        <p>
          In the previous version of this API the send() method accepted the 
          following data types for the data to send: DOMString,Blob, ArrayBuffer 
          or ArrayBufferView. This was aligned with the send() method for 
          Web Sockets. In this Streams API based version only ArrayBuffer is
          accepted as type for data to send. The reason is that encoding issues 
          in a Streams based API should instead be handled by a transform 
          stream.

        Examples of use cases for this API are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li> An email client which communicates with SMTP, POP3 and IMAP servers
        <li> An irc client which communicates with irc servers
        <li> Implementing an ssh app
        <li> Communicating with existing consumer hardware, like internet connected TVs
        <li> Game servers
        <li> Peer-to-peer applications
        <li> Local network multicast service discovery, e.g. UPnP/SSDP and mDNS

         <li>Let the <code>mySocket.output</code> attribute be a new

             object through implementation of a number of functions that are 
             given as input arguments to the constructor and called by the 
             [[!STREAMS]] implementation. The semantics for these 
             functions are described below:

             <ul> 
               <li>The constructor's <code>start()</code> function is called 
                   immediately by the [[!STREAMS]] implementation. 
                   The <code>start()</code> function MUST run the following steps:
                   <ol>
                     <li>Setup the UDP socket to the bound local and remote 
                         address/port pairs in the background (without blocking 
                         scripts). 
                     <li>When the UDP socket has been successfully setup
                         the following steps MUST run:      
                       <ol>
                         <li>Change the <code>mySocket.readyState</code> 
                             attribute's value to "open".    
                         <li>Resolve <code>openedPromise</code> with
                             <code>undefined</code>.
                       </ol>
                   </ol>                       
                   The following internal methods of the ReadableStream are 
                   arguments of the constructor's <code>start()</code> function 
                   and MUST be called by the  <code>start()</code> function 
                   implementation according to the  following steps:
                   <ul>                     
                     <li>The <code>push()</code> argument of <code>start()</code> 
                         is a function that pushes received data into the 
                         internal buffer. <br>
                         When a new UDP datagram has been received the following 
                         steps MUST run:
                         <ol>                                 
                           <li>Create a new instance of <a>UDPMessage</a>.
                           <li>Set the <a>UDPMessage</a> object's 
                               <code>data</code> member to a new read-only 
                               <code>ArrayBuffer</code> object whose contents 
                               are the received UDP datagram [[!TYPED-ARRAYS]].             
                           <li>Set the <code>remoteAddress</code> member of 
                               the <a>UDPMessage</a> object to the source 
                               address of the received UDP datagram.    
                           <li>Set the <code>remotePort</code> member of the 
                               <a>UDPMessage</a> object to the source port 
                               of the received UDP datagram.                                            
                           <li>Call <code>push()</code> to push the
                               <a>UDPMessage</a> object into the internal 
                               [[!STREAMS]] receive buffer. 
                               Note that <code>push()</code> returns false if 
                               the high watermark of the buffer is reached.
                               However, as there is no flow control mechanism
                               in UDP the flow of datagrams can't be stopped.
                               The <code>push()</code> return value should 
                               therefore be ignored. This means that datagrams
                               will be lost if the internal receive buffer 
                               has been filled to it's memory limit but
                               this is the nature of an unreliable protocol
                               as UDP.         
                         </ol>

                          is a function that handles readable stream errors and 
                          closes the readble stream.<br>

                   function is called by the [[!STREAMS]] implementation to 
                   write UDP data. The <code>write()</code> 
                   function MUST run the following steps:

                            and the underlying resource is ready for more data.

      <p>When the <a>TCPSocket</a> constructor is invoked, the User Agent MUST 
         run the following steps:        
        <ol>
         <li>Create a new TCPSocket object ("<code>mySocket</code>").
         <li>If the <code>remoteAddress</code> argument is not a valid IPv4/6 
             address and/or the <code>remotePort</code> argument is not a valid 
             port number then throw DOMException <code>"InvalidAccessError"</code> 
             and abort the remaining steps, else set the <code>mySocket.remoteAddress</code> 
             and <code>mySocket.remotePort</code> attributes to the requested values.
         <li>If the <code>options</code> argument's <code>localAddress</code> 
             member is present and it is a valid IPv4/6 address for a local
             interface that can be used to connect to the selected 
             <code>remoteAddress</code> (according to the routing table) bind the 
             socket to this local IPv4/6 address and set the <code>mySocket.localAddress</code> 
             attribute to this addres. Else, if the <code>localAddress</code> 
             member is present but it is not a valid local IPv4/6 address for a 
             local interface that can be used to connect to the selected 
             <code>remoteAddress</code> then throw DOMException 
             <code>"InvalidAccessError"</code> and abort the remaining steps.<br/>
             Otherwise, if the <code>options</code> argument's <code>localAddress</code> 
             member is absent, execute the following steps: 
             <ol>
               <li> Use the routing table to determine the local interface(s) that
                    can be used to connect to the selected <code>remoteAddress</code>. 
                    If no local interface can be used to connect to the selected 
                    <code>remoteAddress</code> then throw DOMException 
                    <code>"InvalidAccessError"</code> and abort the remaining 
                    steps.
               <li> If the routing table states that more than one local interface 
                    can be used to connect to the selected <code>remoteAddress</code>
                    bind the socket to the IPv4/6 address of the "default" local 
                    interface to use for the selected <code>remoteAddress</code>. 
                    The selection of a "default" local interface is out of scope 
                    for this specification.
               <li> Set the <code>mySocket.localAddress</code> attribute to the 
                    local address that the socket is bound to.             
             </ol>             
         <li>If the <code>options</code> argument's <code>localPort</code> member 
             is absent then bind the socket to an ephemeral local port decided 
             by the system and set the <code>mySocket.localPort</code> attribute 
             to this port. 
             Otherwise, bind the socket to the requested local port and set the 
             <code>mySocket.localPort</code> attribute to the local port that 
             the socket is bound to.             
         <li>Set the <code>mySocket.addressReuse</code> attribute to the value 
             of the <code>options</code> argument's <code>addressReuse</code> 
             member if it is present or to <code>true</code> if the <code>options</code> 
             argument's <code>addressReuse</code> member is not present.
         <li>Set the <code>mySocket.noDelay</code> attribute to the value of 
             the <code>options</code> argument's <code>noDelay</code> member 
             if it is present or to <code>true</code> if the <code>options</code> 
             argument's <code>noDelay</code> member is not present.             
         <li>Set the <code>mySocket.readyState</code> attribute to "opening".          
         <li>Create a new promise, "<code>openedPromise</code>", and store 
             it so it can later be returned by the <code>opened</code> 
             property.    
         <li>Create a new promise, "<code>closedPromise</code>", and store 
             it so it can later be returned by the <code>closed</code> 
             property.               
         
         <li>Let the <code>mySocket.output</code> attribute be a new 
             ReadableStream object, [[!STREAMS]]. The User Agent MUST implement 
             the adaptation layer to [[!STREAMS]] for this new ReadableStream 
             object through implementation of a number of functions that are 
             given as input arguments to the constructor and called by the 
             [[!STREAMS]] implementation. The semantics for these 
             functions are described below:

             <ul> 
               <li>The constructor's <code>start()</code> function is called 
                   immediately by the [[!STREAMS]] implementation. 
                   The <code>start()</code> function MUST run the following steps:
                   <ol>
                     <li>A TCP connection setup handshake to the requested 
                         address and port MUST be performed in the background 
                         (without blocking scripts). 
                     <li>When the TCP connection has been successfully established 
                         the following steps MUST run:      
                       <ol>
                         <li>Change the <code>mySocket.readyState</code> attribute's value to 
                             "open".    
                         <li>Resolve <code>openedPromise</code> with <code>undefined</code>.
                       </ol>
                   </ol>                       
                   The following functions are arguments of the constructor's 
                   <code>start()</code> function and MUST be called by the 
                   <code>start()</code> function implementation according to the
                   following steps:
                   <ul>                     
                     <li>The <code>push()</code> argument of <code>start()</code> 
                         is a function that pushes received data into the 
                         internal buffer. <br>
                         When new TCP data is received the following steps MUST 
                         run:
                         <ol>                                     
                           <li>Create a new read-only <code>ArrayBuffer</code> 
                               object whose contents are the received TCP data.
                           <li>Call <code>push()</code> to push the
                               <code>ArrayBuffer</code> into the internal 
                               [[!STREAMS]] receive buffer. 
                           <li>If the high watermark of the buffer is reached 
                               <code>push()</code> returns false and the TCP 
                               flow control MUST be used to stop the data 
                               transmission from the remote peer.          
                         </ol>                                                           
                     <li>The <code>close()</code> argument of <code>start()</code> 
                         is a function that closes the readable stream.<br> 
                         Upon detection that the TCP connection has been closed
                         cleanly (initiated either by the server, or by 
                         the client application calling <code>close()</code>) 
                         through a successful TCP connection closing handshake 
                         the following steps MUST run:      
                         <ol>  
                           <li>Call <code>close()</code>.  
                           <li>Set the <code>mySocket.readyState</code> attribute's 
                               value to "closed" and release any 
                               underlying resources associated with this socket.  
                           <li>Resolve <code>closedPromise</code> with 
                               <code>undefined</code>.       
                         </ol> 
                      <li>The <code>error()</code> argument of <code>start()</code> 
                          is a function that handles readable stream errors and 
                          closes the readble stream.<br>

             given as input arguments to the constructor and called by the 
             [[!STREAMS]] implementation. The semantics for these 
             functions are described below:
                          
             <ul> 
               <li>The constructor's <code>start()</code> function MUST be
                   omitted as the TCP connection establishment is performed
                   in the <code>mySocket.output</code> attribute constructor's 
                   <code>start()</code> function.                     
               <li>The constructor's <code>write(data, done, error)</code> 
                   function is called by the [[!STREAMS]] implementation to write data to the remote peer on the 
                   TCP connection.
                   The <code>write()</code> function MUST run the following steps:
                   <ol>
                     <li>Send TCP data with data passed in the <code>data</code>
                         parameter to the address and port of the recipient as 
                         stated by the TCPSocket object constructor's 
                         <code>remoteAddress</code> and <code>remotePort</code> 
                         fields.
                   </ol>                              
                   The following functions are arguments of the constuctor's 
                   <code>write()</code> function and MUST be called by the 
                   <code>write()</code> function implementation:
                   <ul>
                     <li>The <code>done()</code> argument of <code>write()</code> 
                         is a function that MUST be called when the 
                         buffered data has been sent to the remote peer  
                         the underlying resource is ready for more data. 
                     <li>The <code>error(errorReason)</code> argument of <code>write()</code> 
                         is a function that MUST be called if an error 
                         ocurred during writing. (<code>errorReason</code>
                         TBD).                         
                   </ul>                  
                      
               <li>The constructor's <code>close()</code> 
                   function is called by the [[!STREAMS]] implementation to close the writable side 
                   of the connection, that is a TCP "half close" is performed.
                   The <code>close()</code> function MUST run the following steps:
                    <ol>
                     <li>If <code>mySocket.readyState</code> is "closing" or "closed" then 
                         do nothing.
                     <li>If <code>mySocket.readyState</code> is "opening" then complete 
                         the connection attempt. If succesful send FIN and set the 
                         <code>mySocket.readyState</code> attribute to "halfclosed".
                     <li>If <code>mySocket.readyState</code> is "open" then send FIN and 
                         set the <code>mySocket.readyState</code> attribute to "halfclosed".                     
                   </ol>
 
             </ul>                                         
                                  
         <li>Return the newly created <a>TCPSocket</a> object ("<code>mySocket</code>") 
             to the application.
        </ol>
      </p>                               
    
      <p> The <dfn><code>close()</code></dfn> method when invoked MUST run the 
          following steps:

          <li>Call <code>mysocket.output.cancel(reason)</code>. (Reason codes TBD.)  
        </ol>
      </p>
